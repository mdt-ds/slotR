### how to play
_slotR is a simple slot machine game of chance inspired by R: make your bet and spin the reels!_

- R symbols make you win, Python ones make you loose,

- two or three equal hexagons make you win,

- NAs hexagons are bad,

- you can bet all of your money but no less than 100 credits,

- payout is computed multiplying the bet by a factor resulting from adding the values reported on the payout table depending on which and how many symbols appear in the reels,
          
- if you run out of money you can ask for credit but no more than twice,

### how to configure the reels
The tab panel _slotR config_ allows to customize the reels inserting how many stops by selecting the sliders in the sidebar panel.

At every change in the stops quantity the probabilities are recomputed and displayed in the main panel.

The customized reels can be used in actual play only after clicking the change reel button.

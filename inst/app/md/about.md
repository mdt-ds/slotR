### Acknowleddgments
Without the "stay at home" directive due to COVID pandemic __slotR__ would have not seen the light but it is hard to feel any gratitude for this.

Thanks instead are for R and all people that keep R alive and kicking.

A special thank to Colin Fay and [ThinkR](https://rtask.thinkr.fr) for publishing the `{hexmake}` app which made me imagine an _R slot machine_. 

### Colophon 

The __slotR__ app is hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) service by RStudio.

The whole __slotR__ app is powererd by [`{shiny}`](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny).

[`{golem}`](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) framework enabled the organization of slotR in an R-package. 

Hex logos were generated using [`{hexmake}`](https://connect.thinkr.fr/hexmake/).

To see the full list of packages used in the app, refer to the [DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/mdt-ds/slotR/master/DESCRIPTION) file.
